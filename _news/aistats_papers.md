I'm happy to announce that two of our papers, [Analyzing Explainer Robustness via Probabilistic Lipschitzness of Prediction Functions](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v238/q-khan24a.html) and [Boundary-Aware Uncertainty for Feature Attribution Explainers](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v238/hill24a.html) were accepted into AISTATS (2024).
